# Fixes Applied to Smart Alarm Application

## Date: October 19, 2025

### Issues Fixed

#### 1. Missing Dependencies

- **Fix**: Installed `@nivo/calendar` package
- **Command**: `npm install @nivo/calendar`

#### 2. Missing Icon Imports in MoodTracker.jsx
- **Issue**: Icons were imported with different names than used in the code
- **Fixes Applied**:
  - Added `LinearProgress` to Material-UI imports
  - Fixed icon names in `moodOptions` array:
    - `SentimentVerySatisfiedIcon` → `HappyIcon`
    - `SentimentSatisfiedAltIcon` → `GoodIcon`
    - `SentimentSatisfiedIcon` → `NeutralIcon`
    - `SentimentDissatisfiedIcon` → `SadIcon`
    - `SentimentVeryDissatisfiedIcon` → `VerySadIcon`

#### 3. Missing Icon Imports in Settings.jsx
- **Issue**: Multiple icons were used but not imported
- **Fixes Applied**: Added the following icon imports:
  - `AccessTime as AccessTimeIcon`
  - `Straighten as StraightenIcon`
  - `Bedtime as BedtimeIcon`
  - `Mood as MoodIcon`
  - `Insights as InsightsIcon`
  - `BarChart as BarChartIcon`
  - `LocationOn as LocationOnIcon`
  - `Facebook as FacebookIcon`
  - `Twitter as TwitterIcon`
  - `Instagram as InstagramIcon`
  - `LinkedIn as LinkedInIcon`

#### 4. Missing Icon Imports in SleepTracker.jsx
- **Issue**: `AccessTimeIcon` and `TrendingUpIcon` were used but not imported
- **Fixes Applied**: Added the following icon imports:
  - `AccessTime as AccessTimeIcon`
  - `TrendingUp as TrendingUpIcon`

### Current Status

✅ **All Errors Fixed**
- Application compiles successfully
- Only minor ESLint warnings remain (non-breaking)
- Both frontend and backend are running properly

### Running Servers

- **Backend**: http://localhost:5000 ✅
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000 ✅
- **MongoDB**: Connected to Atlas ✅

### Remaining Warnings (Non-Critical)

The following ESLint warnings exist but don't affect functionality:
1. React Hook `useEffect` missing dependencies in `AuthContext.js`
2. Unused `Tooltip` import in `MainLayout.jsx`
3. React Hook `useEffect` missing dependencies in `MainLayout.jsx`

These can be addressed later as code improvements but don't prevent the app from working.

### Next Steps

1. Test user registration and login
2. Test all features (Dashboard, Sleep Tracker, Mood Tracker, Settings)
3. Optionally fix ESLint warnings for cleaner code
4. Consider adding more features or improvements
